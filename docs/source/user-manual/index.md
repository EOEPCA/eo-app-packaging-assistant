## Introduction 

The Assistant is an online web application that allows building Docker images and generating
CWL-formatted CLT snippets in an interactive manner. The CLT snippets are generated according to
the [OGC Best Practice for Earth Observation Application Package](https://docs.ogc.org/bp/20-089r1.html).

The Assistant allows:

- specifying the **Command Line Tool properties** to be included in the CWL snippet. Command Line
  Tools (also called Processing Tasks) are executable, non-interactive programs that read some
  inputs, perform a computation, and terminate after producing some outputs.
- uploading the **application implementation files** to be packaged in a Docker image. The files
  must contain the executable (pre-compile if necessary) code of the program and any configuration
  and data files required for executing the program. These files are copied in a Docker image
  during the build operation.
- selecting the **software dependencies** that must also be present in the Docker image to permit
  the execution of the program. Software dependencies are automatically installed during the build
  operation.
- performing a **dry-run of the application packaging** to verify the application is executable
  in the Docker image without persisting that image.
- executing the **application packaging** to build, test and persist the Docker image in a Docker
  repository, and generate the corresponding CWL snippet.

The Assistant uses a form based interface for providing or selecting the necessary inputs. The
validation and building operations are performed in the back-end and feedback is displayed on the
interface in real-time.

The Assistant generates a Docker image that contains the application executable files, and a CLT
snippet encoded in CWL that contains the CLT properties, including the address of the Docker image.


## CommandLineTool Creation Guidelines

The creation of an application starts with the implementation of the actual processing task. This
must be done offline, using inputs available locally and storing generated outputs locally as well.
The result consists of:

- the files that implement the processing task,
- the definition of the command line: the main executable, possibly using an interpreted, and its
  arguments,
- the software dependencies, such as native Linux or Python libraries used by the processing task.

These elements are used in the EO Application Packaging Assistant to build the Docker image and
generate the CWL snippet. 


## EO Application Packaging Assistant

### Interface Overview

The interface of the EO Application Packaging Assistant is divided in 3 main sections whose purpose
is shown in the Figure *User Interface Overview*:

1. **Header section**: This section inlucdes a drop-down menu that provides users with links and
   features helping the user to use the Assistant.
2. **Configuration Section**: This is the main section of the Assistant used to specify the CLT
   properties, upload implementation files, and configure the software dependencies. It also
   contains controls to manage the CLT snippet files generated by the editor. Users here can
   choose from where to open or save a CWL file as well as edit the name of it and its version.
3. **Build Section**: This section contains the controls for building the Docker images and
   generating the CWL snippets. It is possible to proceed with a *dry-run*, meaning the build is
   performed but the Docker image is not persisted, or with a build followed by the storage of the
   Docker image in a Docker registry.

Note that if the user screen or browser window is not wide enough, the Build Section automatically
moves below the Configuration Section.

### Header Section

The header section provides a helper menu from which users can change general settings of the EO
Application Packaging Assistant, access applicable documents and start guided tours on how to use
the user interface. The helper menu provides the following actions as can be seen in the
*Helper Menu* figure:

- **Reset**: Resets the application configuration to a default state, that is without any
  Application configuration loaded. The user is asked to confirm this action as it may lead to
  loosing unsaved changes.
- **Editing Mode**: Allows users to choose between *Simple* and *Advanced* modes. In *Advanced*
  mode, the forms show optional fields that are not regularly used. By default the *Simple* mode
  is enabled as it makes the interface look simpler and less complex.
- **Manuals & References**: Gives users access to applicable documentation such as this User Manual
  and the OGC Best Practice document for Earth Observation Application Package.
- **Guided Tour**: Provides users with an interactive guided tour that demonstrates an end-to-end
  use of the Assistant.

![Helper Menu](../assets/user_manual/help_menu.png)
*<p style="text-align: center;">Helper Menu</p>*


### File Management Section

The file management buttons located in the Command Line Tool title bar provide users with a set of
controls to transfer, save and manage the CWL snippets created using the EO Application Packaging
Assistant. The possible actions are as shown in this figure:

![File Management Actions](../assets/user_manual/file_manager_actions.png)
*<p style="text-align: center;">File Management Actions</p>*


#### Workspace Actions: Save and Manage

These actions allow saving and managing Application configuration as CWL files in the Workspace of
the current user. Note: this requires the EO Application Packaging Assistant to be running in an
EOEPCA Workspace.

The **Save** button opens a popup dialog box that allows saving the current CLT snippet as a CWL
file in the user Workspace. In this box, users can change the snippet name and version before
performing the save.

![Application Save Popup](../assets/user_manual/workspace_saver.png)
*<p style="text-align: center;">Application Save Popup</p>*

The **Manage** button opens a manager that allows users to explore and manage the Applications
saved in their workspace. Users have the possibility to navigate between Applications and see the
saved versions. This manager also provides version specific actions that allow the user to **open,
lock, unlock, delete and download** each Application version.

![Application Manager](../assets/user_manual/app_manager.png)
*<p style="text-align: center;">Application Manager</p>*

![Application Versions Manager](../assets/user_manual/app_versions_manager.png)
*<p style="text-align: center;">Application Versions Manager</p>*

#### Transfer Actions

These actions allow users to transfer Application CWL files from their local storage to the tool
and vice versa. Two actions are available:

- **Upload**: The upload button allows users to directly load an Application CWL file from their
  local storage in order to edit it using the EO Application Packaging Assistant.
- **Download**: The download button allows users to download the Application currently loaded in
  the EO Application Packaging Assistant as a CWL file on the local system.


#### Combining Actions

The workspace and transfer actions can be used together meaning that a user can transfer an
Application CWL file from his local storage to the Assistant and then save it directly in his
Workspace and vice versa.

### Configuration Section

The **Configuration Section** is the main section of the EO Application Packaging Assistant and
consists of three sub-pages titled **Command Line Tool**, **Application Files** and
**Build Options**, as shown in the next figure. More information about these tabs are available by
clicking the information icons next to the tab name.

#### Command Line Tool

The **Command Line Tool** tab in the editor section allows users to specify the properties of the
processing task, including the executable program name, inputs, outputs and requirements that must
be met in order to execute the processing task.

As shown in the *Editor Command Line Tool Tab* figure, a user can:

1. Enter an identifier for the processing task. This identifier is mandatory as it allows
   referring to the processing tasks when integrated as jobs in a CWL workflow. Note that the
   class of the process is set to `CommandLineTool` and cannot be changed. A human-friendly label
   and description may also be entered as this will be more informative to the users who want to
   use this application in their workflows.
2. Specify the program to execute to process the inputs. If defined as an array, the first element
   of the array is the command to execute, and subsequent elements are mandatory command line
   arguments.
3. Specify the command line bindings which are not directly associated with input parameters.
4. Define the inputs of the processing task with their id, type, default value and input bindings.
   Note that providing inputs default values is not mandatory but allows verifying the program can
   be executed during the build process (as explained in the [Build section](#build-panel), below).
5. Define the outputs of the processing task with their identifier, type, and output bindings.
6. Add the requirements that must be met in order to execute the processing task. Note: The EO
   Application Packaging Assistant will automatically insert a `DockerRequirement` when the
   application Docker image is built.

Note that the content of the inputs and outputs configuration forms highly depends on the editing
mode (explained in the [Header Section](#header-section)). If you are missing options in these
forms, switch to the Advanced mode in the Helper Menu.

![Command Line Tool Tab](../assets/user_manual/tab_CommandLineTool.png)
*<p style="text-align: center;">Command Line Tool Tab</p>*

#### Application Files

The **Application Files** tab contains a drop-zone that allows users upload the files implementing
the program. These may include native (pre-compiled) executable files, scripts, configuration and
data files. The files may be dragged and dropped on the drop-zone, but clicking on that area also
reveals a file selection box that allows navigating and selecting the files to be uploaded.

All regular files uploaded this way will be copied in the same folder in the application Docker
image.

Two special mechanisms are also supported:

- If a file named `requirements.txt` is uploaded, this is used during the build process to install
  the Python packages listed in it (i.e. using the standard `pip` command).

- Uploaded `*.tar` or `*.tgz` files are automatically inflated during the build process. This
  allows copying a high amount of files at once as well as organising the program files in a folder
  hierarchy.

Files uploaded by mistake cannot be removed individually. Click on the **Remove All Files** button
before uploading the correct files again.

On the following figure two files have been uploaded in the drop-zone: `numpy_test.py` and
`requirements.txt`:

![Application Files Tab](../assets/user_manual/tab_ApplicationFiles.png)
*<p style="text-align: center;">Application Files Tab</p>*


#### Build Options

The **Build Options** tab allows specifying the software tools and libraries required to execute
the program in the application Docker image and the repository where the Docker image must be
pushed.

**Software Dependencies**

As explained above, Python packages may be installed by including a `requirements.txt` file in the
application files, however this does not allow installing native libraries, for example.

Note: The available software dependencies depend on the actual configuration of the EO Application
Packaging Assistant. Different platforms may propose different options. Instructions for
configuring the Assistant may be found in the
[GitHub `README`](https://github.com/eoepca/eo-app-packaging-assistant).

Click on the "Software Dependencies" list to reveal the pre-configured dependencies and select the
ones that are required. Internally, the Assistant takes care of cross-dependencies and
incompatibilities. If a selected software is incompatible with others, these are grayed out in the
list.

**Registry**

The **Registry** form allows indicating where the generated Docker image must be pushed after a
successful build. Two options are provided:

- When **Default Service Registry** is selected, the default registry configured in the EO
  Application Packaging Assistant is used. Note that this relies on how the Assistant has been
  configured (see [GitHub `README`](https://github.com/eoepca/eo-app-packaging-assistant)).

- When **Custom Registry** is selected, the user may enter the address of a publicly accessible
  Docker registry (for both pulling and pushing Docker images). The address may contain the path
  to be prepended to the Docker image name.

The name of the generated Docker image will always contain the identifier of the application. The
**Image tag** field allows entering a custom tag for differenciating different versions of the
application.

When a custom registry is used, the resulting image address is:
`<registry-name>/<image-path>/<image-identifier>:<image-tag>`

In the following figure, the **Flask** software is selected. Its availability will be verified by
executing the `/app/numpy_test.py` script as configured in the Command Line Tool panel.

### Build Section

The **Build Section**, located on the right side of the page, provides the buttons to trigger the
build process and accessing the corresponding logs.

![Build Section](../assets/user_manual/build_section.png)
*<p style="text-align: center;">Build Section</p>*

#### Build Panel

The **Build** panel contains the following elements:

- A **Build (Dry Run)** button allows building a Docker image copying (and extracting if necessary)
  the uploaded application files and installing the selected software dependencies. When the build
  is complete, the Docker image is deleted and not persisted in a registry.
- The checkbox **Perform a test run with default values** allows requesting the application program
  to be actually executed in a Docker container using the default values given to the application
  input parameters. Note: For this option to be available, all the mandatory parameters must have
  been given a default value (in the [Command Line Tool](#command-line-tool) tab). **It is
  recommended to the application developers to take this into account and foresee in their program
  code the detection of the default values in order to perform some sanity checks instead of a real
  processing**. Real processing would likely fail anyway as no input files are actually stated-in
  during a test run. Performing a test run is helpful, for example, to verify that all the Python
  libraries necessary to running the program may be imported.
- The **Build and Push to Repository** button is used to trigger the build of a Docker image,
  perform a test run if requested, and if successful, push the new image in the Docker registry
  selected by the user.

**Live outputs** may be displayed during the build process. Internally, more detailed logs are
collected. These may be obtained when the build process is complete (successfully or not), by
clicking on the **Show detailed logs** button.

*<p style="text-align: center;">Build Live Output</p>*

![Build Success](../assets/user_manual/build_success.png)
*<p style="text-align: center;">Build Success</p>*

Detailed logs are displayed in a popup dialog box when the **Show detailed logs** button is
clicked. The log text may be copied as necessary:

*<p style="text-align: center;">Build Detailed Logs</p>*


#### CWL Snippet Panel

This panel displays the CWL snippet synchronised with the application properties entered in the
[Command Line Tool](#command-line-tool) form. The view is updated after every action of the user in
the form.

The `DockerRequirement` entry and the `dockerPull` property are also automatically inserted after a
successful build.
